# Autonomous_Mobile_Robot
Made a autonomous mobile robot (a three wheeler car) which would avoid the obstacle by taking left or right 
w.r.t to the ultrasonic sensor relative distance correspondingly. This was done using Linear sepatrix method of regression model (Machine Learning). 
This can be implemented using both Arduino (NodeMcu) as well as Rasberry Pi.
All the available codes are attached to the projected along with implementation done using Rasberry Pi
